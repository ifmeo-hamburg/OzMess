# To update

## Online

- Add the references (Lueck paper, Elbe estuary) 
- Add links to the online text books

- Add photos/reports of student work from 2023?
- Add links to the gitlab repository
- Add some additional detail on the experimental design (what students from last year said)

- Create or suggest what a logsheet should include (maybe printed is better than messy notebooks)

- Consider adding a few python scripts into the online markdown to give examples for how to handle data

- May need some additional how-tos for using the instruments (quickstart sheets?)
- Link from somewhere else to this page (min moodle)?

##Â Git

- Later, see about whether using github is better (or stick with gitlab)
