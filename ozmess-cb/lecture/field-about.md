# Field experiment: Measuring salinity

## Objectives
- Measure the salinity in the Elbe estuary
- Make (and partially test) a hypothesis about sources of salinity variability

As one group, follow the [exercise sheet](../exercise/field-1-excursion) for ideas about how to set up your experiment.

```{tip}
Divide tasks within the group for efficiency, but ensure everyone understands the whole process.
```

## Suggestion
- Recommended location:   since for WiSe2324 we‘ve been   to work there.
- Install necessary software or use lab computer. If using a lab computer, you must include this in your list of necessary equipment provided at 15:00 on the course day before the field excursion.


```{tip}
We can provide advice.  If in doubt, *ask* before trying something.
```

## Some ideas to get you started

- Find the salinity from the North Sea from literature or past Seepraktikums; find the salinity in the Elbe in Hamburg.
- Identify a location for measurements. Use e.g. local maps or Google maps to check for water access. Ideally there will be a dock from which you can lower the instrument.
- Find and note the expected tides for your chosen location and time of day.
- You will likely need to make repeat measurements over at least 6 hours; decide the frequency of measurement and depth (if applicable).
- Ensure you outline all required materials in time (including the required instruments and auxiliary equipment), needed ropes, floats, life vests, etc..
- Plan the figures you intend to create from the data. When designing your experiment, consider what these figures will look like, and how you‘ll use the data to evaluate variability.


```{warning}
Human safety first. Equipment safety second.
