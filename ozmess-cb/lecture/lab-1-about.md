# Lab 1: Measuring salinity

## Objective
- Evaluate accuracy of salinity measurements using at least 3 methods/instruments

In groups, follow the [exercise sheet](../exercise/lab-1-salinometry) for ideas about how to set up your experiment.

```{tip}
Divide tasks within the group for efficiency, but ensure everyone understands the whole process.
```

## Suggestion
- Gather datasheets for different instruments, and compare the stated accuracies.
- Note serial numbers and check last calibrations. Note the instrument details – what are the recommended operating ranges.
- Plan to install necessary software or use lab computer for downloading data from the instrument.
- Plan to include a calculation for uncertainty propagation.

```{tip}
We can provide advice.  If in doubt, *ask* before trying something.
```

## Some ideas to get you started

- You will want to make several repeat measurements, and in water with different salinities. Ensure your salinities (which you will create) are near the allowable ranges of the instrument.
- In Lab 2, you will have the opportunity to measure some of the saltwater you create using the salinometer and verified with standard seawater (near salinity of 35).
- Plan to create figures evaluating conductivity (for the CTDs) and salinity. When designing your experiment, consider what these figures will look like, and how you‘ll use the data to discuss accuracy and precision.
- If using a pumped microCAT, do not run the pump dry (i.e. don‘t run it in air). It should be submerged while running always. Consider an extra bucket of room temperature water to protect the instrument.



```{warning}
Human safety first. Equipment safety second.
```

## What's due?

1. Document outlining the experimental design, and
2. Report with conclusions after the experiment was carried out
