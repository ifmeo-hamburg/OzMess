# Course content

1. Experiment (Lab): Lab-based measurements of salinity - To evaluate instrument accuracy and precision.

2. Experiment (Lab): Lab-based measurements of salinity to evaluate the thermal inertia of an instrument 


3. Experiment (Field): Make field-based measurements of salinity variability somewhere along the Elbe.

Student learning outcomes:
- Understanding measurement principles for salinity.
- Designing experiments to test specific hypotheses related to measuring salinity.
- Using instruments: Setup, programming, protocols and downloading data.
- Data processing: For electronic CTD instruments, using manufacturerâ€™s software and programming in Python.
