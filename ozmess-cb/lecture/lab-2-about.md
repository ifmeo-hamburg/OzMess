# Lab 2: Cell thermal mass

## Objective
- Document the effect of cell thermal mass on a salinity measurement

In groups, follow the [exercise sheet](../exercise/lab-2-cell-thermal-mass) for ideas about how to set up your experiment.

```{tip}
Divide tasks within the group for efficiency, but ensure everyone understands the whole process.
```

## Suggestion
- Clarify for yourself what the cell thermal mass problem is and how it manifests in data.
- Gather datasheets, manual for SBE37 and for Seabird processing software. Note the instrument details - what are the allowable ranges?
- Plan to install necessary software or use lab computer for downloading data from the instrument.

```{tip}
We can provide advice.  If in doubt, *ask* before trying something.
```

## Some ideas to get you started

- You will need to change the temperature of the conductivity cell of the microCAT. What are the allowable temperature ranges? You may use ice.
- You will want to make several repeat measurements, and consider using water with different salinities /temperatures, but not too many! Ensure your salinities (which you will create) are within the allowable ranges of the instrument.
- If using a pumped microCAT, do not run the pump dry (i.e., **donâ€˜t run it in air**). It should be submerged while running. Consider an extra bucket of water to protect the instrument between setup and starting the experiment.



```{warning}
Human safety first. Equipment safety second.
```

## What's due?

1. Document outlining the experimental design, and
2. Report with conclusions after the experiment was carried out
