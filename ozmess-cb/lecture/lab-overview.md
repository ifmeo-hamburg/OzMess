# Overview: Lab Experiments

## Objectives
- Develop experiments to measure salinity
- Assess how the principles of measurement for the given instrument affect the accuracy of methods
- Critically consider limitations based on how the instrument is used


## Assessment
- Participation is required for planning, execution and reporting on experiments
- Reports: Produce documents for the experimental design and results
- Presentation

## Available materials (examples)
- Water, salt, ice
- Buckets, scales, stirring implements, small bucket, funnel
